# Samosa Sharpness Analyzer ðŸŽ¯

## Basic Details
###  Name: Shan A



### Project Description
A fun and interactive React web app that analyzes the sharpness of your samosaâ€™s corners from an uploaded photo by detecting its triangular shape using the Gemini API Flash 2.0 .

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone struggles to judge how crispy and perfectly triangular their samosa corners are just by looking! Thereâ€™s no scientific way to measure samosa sharpnessâ€”until now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a playful web app that takes your samosaâ€™s photo, detects the triangle shape using advanced image analysis, calculates corner angles, and gives you a fun "Triangle Perfection Score" with crispiness commentary. Because geometry tastes better with chai!
